       |        Operator        |
    operands                 operands

Modules         ( % ) For Calculate remainder of two operands and etc.
Exponentiation  ( ** ) For Multiply and etc.

Unary operators 

Inreament       ( + ) For Sum and etc.
post increament a++
pre increament  ++a

Decrement       ( - ) For Minus and etc.
post decrement a--
pre decrement  --a


Assignment Operators

- ,+=, -=, *=, %=

a =  1 (a = a = 1) 
a += 1 (a = a + 1) 
a -= 1 (a = a - 1) 
a *= 1 (a = a * 1) 
a %= 1 (a = a % 1) 

Comparison Operators

Equal to            ( == )
Not Equal to        ( != )
Equal to & Type     ( === ) strict version
Not Equal to & Type ( !== ) strict version

Greater than          ( > )

Greater Than Equal to ( >= )
Less Than Equal to    ( <= )


Logical Operators

Logical AND ( && )
Logical OR  ( || )
Logical NOT  ( ! )


Condition Statements : To implement
some condition in the code

1. if Statement :

Syntax: if(condition){
               code
        }

2. if else Statement :

Syntax: if(condition){
                code
        } else{
             code
        }

3. else-if Statement

Syntax : if(condition){
                code
        } else if(condition){
                   code
        } else{
              code
        }


4. Ternary Operator
    Syntax : 
            condition ? true output : false output;
 

5. Switch Statement
Syntax :

         switch (expression) {
             case caseExpression:
                 statements
             case caseExpression:
                 statements
             case caseExpression:
                 statements
             default:
                 statements
         }
